# What is this?

Manage your database and models in Laravel 8 / PHP 8 by defining the target schema (migrations are generated automatically).

# Installation

Edit composer.json:

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/niogu/migratoro"
    }
],
```

```
composer require --dev niogu/migratoro:dev-master
```

# Example

Create a file `database/schema.txt`:
```
Human
    name: string
```

Run:

```
php artisan migratoro
```

This:

1. Generates a migration to create `humans` table with `name` field
2. Generates/updates `App\Models\Human` model

Change the `database/schema.txt` to this:

```
Human
    name: string
    height: float
```

And again, `php artisan migratoro`.

Now you have 2 migrations and 2 fields in the database.

Want more?

```
Human
    name: string
    height: float
    pets()

Pet
    human()
```

... and now you have methods like `App\Models\Human::first()->pets()->first()` and `App\Models\Pet::first()->human`
and `human_id` on `pets` table.

(Everything related to database is done through migrations, model code changes are non-reversible automatically, at least for now)

**But wait, there's more!**

* Generate fields
* Generate relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many, has many through, polymorphic)
* Many to many with automatic pivot table creation
* Generate relationship methods on models, creation of indexes
* Create indexes, composite indexes, unique and composite unique indexes
* Rename and delete fields and indexes (renaming of indexes requires Laravel 5.6.23+, with [my small contribution](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/24147) to the framework)
* Generate/update `$casts` attributes for collection, array, and JSON types
* Default values
* Self-reference
* Enums
* Guarded fields
* Custom pivot tables and field names, `as`, `withTimestamps`, etc...
* Custom namespace and paths for models
* Composite primary keys
* Date and Time with automatic `$casts` to Carbon models
* ...probably something else too (read all about it below)

Note: by default all generated fields are `nullable` (yes, you can change this to default to `not nullable`, [see below](#null)).

## Status: alpha testing, so be warned:

> Note: The package works, but it is in very early stages, be careful.

> Do **git commits** before you run it
> (it will change your models files, hopefully correctly, but just in case -
> you have an option to `git reset --hard`)
> and back up your local development databases periodically!

> It shouldn't do anything malicious/bad, but the package is pretty new and possibly unstable

> Does it work? Well, there are 3000+ lines of tests, so it should... hopefully...

# Longer usage example

Create a file `database/schema.txt`:
```
Human
    name: string
    height: float
    pets()
    pet_tags() via Pet: Tag[]

Pet
    name: string Default("Kitty"), NotNull
    born: datetime
    nicknames: array
    human()
    colors()
    tags()

Color
    color: string NotNull
    pets()

Tag
    material: enum(['copper','gold'])
    pet()
```

and then:

```
php artisan migratoro
```

This will run all your existing migrations, look at the database,
create necessary *migrations* to make the `humans`, `pets`, `colors` tables look like described
(though, it will not delete existing fields, unless asked)
and also will create or update `\App\Models\Human`, `App\Models\Pet`, `App\Models\Color` Eloquent *models*
with some `$cast` attributes and methods like `pet_tags()`, `pets()`, `colors()`, `tags()`.

This defines a few models and a few relationships:

* Human has many Pets (one to many)
* Pet has many Colors (many to many with pivot table) and Tags (one to many)
* Human has many Tags through(via) Pet (has many through)

It will also create `color_pet` Many to Many pivot table with `color_id` and `pet_id`
fields (everything is customizable).

So, now you can do:

```
$human = App\Models\Human::create(['name' => 'Jen']);

$kitty = $human->pets()->create(['name' => 'Kitty the Cat']);

$gray = App\Models\Color::create(['color' => 'gray']);

$kitty->colors()->attach($gray->id);

$kitty->tags()->create(['material' => 'gold']);

>>> $human->pet_tags

=> Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {
     all: [
       App\Models\Tag {
         id: 1,
         material: "gold",
         pet_id: 1,
         human_id: 1,
         ...

```

Does the enum work?

```

$kitty->tags()->create(['material' => 'unobtanium']);
... Check violation: 7 ERROR:  new row for relation "tags" violates
    check constraint "tags_material_check"

```

How about some JSON in models via `$casts`? Got it!

```
$kitty->update(['nicknames' => ['Kitte', 'Hey you']]);

>>> App\Models\Pet::first()->nicknames

=> [
     "Kitte",
     "Hey you",
   ]

```

Date/time via Carbon and `$casts`? Yes!

```
$kitty->update(['born' => '2010-01-01']);

>>> App\Models\Pet::first()->born->diffForHumans();
=> "8 years ago"

```

Want to **change** something?

Easy!

Change it, run `php artisan migratoro` - it
will look at what needs to be done, create migrations and update your models,
like adding an **`Unique`** index for example:

Change schema.txt, add `Unique`:

```
(skipped)

Pet
    name: string Default("Kitty"), NotNull, Unique

(skipped)
```

An unique index named `pets_name_unique_idx` (customizable) will be created (can span multiple fields too).

```
>>> $kitty = $human->pets()->create(['name' => 'Kitty the Cat']);
...

>>> $kitty = $human->pets()->create(['name' => 'Kitty the Cat']);
... Unique violation: 7 ERROR:  duplicate key value violates
    unique constraint "pets_name_unique_idx"
```

# Comments

Comments start with `#`:

```
Human:
    # This is an old typo, but don't fix it
    first_nane: string
```

# Relationships

## One to many

```
Post
    comments()

Comment
    post()
```

Now we have `$post->comments()` and `$comment->post()`.

The field `post_id` will be created automatically in `comments` table.

You can change the field name to `my_post_id` like this: `post() via my_post_id`.

## Different names

What if we want to have methods named `remarks()` (instead of `comments()`), but pointing to `Comment`?
Also `$comment->parent()` (instead of `post()`)?
Easy, just add a "return type".

```
Post
    remarks(): Comment[]

Comment
    parent() Post
```

`Comment[]` means that this method returns `multiple` (collection) of `Comment`'s.

## One to one

```
User
    phone()

Phone
    user() via user_id
```

One to one is less obvious, since by default we don't know if `users` table
should have `phone_id` or `phones` table should have `user_id`.
If you try to create it without `via` - the error will try to help you
figuring out where to specify it:

```
User
    phone()

Phone
    user()
```

Results in:

Error:

> Model User contains a confusing One to One definition between `User.phone()`
and `Phone.user()`. One to one requires a field in one of these tables.
To resolve it:
if User (usually) belongs to Phone - then add `phone() via phone_id` to User;
otherwise if Phone (usually) belongs to User -  then add `user() via user_id` to Phone.

Which is easy to fix: add `via user_id` to `user()` definition:

```
User
    phone()

Phone
    user() via user_id
```

## Many to many

```
User
    roles()

Role
    users()
```

This will also automatically create migration to create `role_user` table
with `role_id` and `user_id` fields.

(see below for more complex cases, like changing the join, creating intermediary
table, specifying pivot name, etc...)

## Has many through

So, the `Country` has many `Users`, each `User` has many `Posts`.
How do we get all `Country`'s `Posts`?

After you do the two `has many` parts, the last part is `Country`: `posts() via User`:

```
Country
    users()
    posts() via User

User
    posts()
    country()

Post
    user()
```

Now you can call `$country->posts()`

## Polymorphic (like comments for multiple things)

`Posts` and `Videos` should have comments, but 1 comment can't belong to
2+ `Posts` or `Post` and `Video` at the same time.

```
Post
    comments()

Video
    comments()

Comment
    commentable(): Post|Video
```

`commentable(): Post|Video` is the "polymorphic return type"
(it returns a single `Post` or single `Video`), which will
create `commentable_type` and `commentable_id` fields.
 
Now, we have `$post->comments()`, `$video->comments()`.

## Polymorphic many to many (like tags for multiple things)

`Posts` and `Videos` can both have `Tags`, but same `Tag` can be for
2+ `Posts` or `Post` and `Video` at the same time.
(Requires intermediate `Taggable` model)

```
Post
    name: string
    tags() via Taggable

Video
    name: string
    tags() via Taggable

Tag
    name: string
    posts() via Taggable
    videos() via Taggable
    taggables()

Taggable
    tag()
    taggable(): Post|Video
```

So, now we have `$post->tags()`, `$video->tags()`, `$tag->videos()` and `$tag->posts()`.

Remark: if you need to specify a return type and via, the syntax is:

```
Tag
    posts() via Taggable: Post[]
```

# Self-reference (one to many)

`Employee` can have many `Employees` (boss is defined via the field `boss_id`).

```
Employee
    boss() via boss_id: Employee <- Employee.employees()
    employees(): Employee[] <- Employee.boss()
```

`<- Human.employees()` defines the inverse relationship.

Now we can do: `$employee->boss()` and `$employee->employees()`

*Remark:*

```
boss() via boss_id: Employee <- Employee.employees()
```

means "method `boss()`, which is defined `via` implcitly created field `boss_id`,
which returns single Employee, and inverse method is `Employee.employees()`.

```
employees(): Employee[]
```

means that method returns multiple `Employee`s (the return type here is
not strictly necessary, since method name is plural).

# Changing namespace

By default models are created in `\App\Models` namespace (where `User` usually is),
but you can change that:

```
namespace App\Other

Model
    name: string
```

If you don't create models in namespace starting with `\App`, you need to
specify the path too:

```
namespace MyModels src/MyModels

Model
    name: string
```

# Date and time

```
User
    since: datetime
    until: date
    birth_time: dateTimeTz
```

This also creates `$casts ... => 'datetime'` in model, so fields are `Carbon`

# Types with parameters

```
VeryMathematicalModel
    c: char(100) NotNull
    d: decimal(8)
    d1: decimal(8, 2)
    f: float(8, 2)
    s: string(100)
    ud: unsignedDecimal(8, 2)
    en: enum(['easy','hard'])
```

# Default values

```
User
    name: string Default("Mr.Y")
```

# JSON types

```
User
    history1: json
    history2: jsonb
    history3: collection
    history4: array
```

This also creates `$casts` in model.

# Indexes

```
Item
    title: string Index
    slug: string Unique

    complex1: string Index(index_named_one)
    complex2: string Index(index_named_two)

    unique1: string Unique(index_named_one)
    unique2: string Unique(index_named_two)
```

# Null
<a name="null"></a>

Everything is nullable by default, so to make something "not null":

```
Item
    price: integer NotNull
```

Default can be changed:

```
default not null
Item
    price: integer
```

# Rename/delete fields, indexes

```
Item
    title: string
```

change to:

```
Item
    title1: string
    RENAME FIELD title TO title1
```

Also has `DELETE FIELD field_name`, `RENAME INDEX name_from TO name_to`, `DELETE INDEX index_name`.

# Primary keys

```
User
    user_primary_key: increments PrimaryKey
```

# Guarded fields (default is unguarded)

```
User
    is_admin: boolean Guarded
    is_admin2: boolean Guarded
```

(This also creates `$guarded` in model)

Or change the default:

```
default guarded

User
    is_admin: boolean
    is_admin2: boolean
```

# Many to many (with different field names)

```
User
    user_field1: integer
    name: string
    roles(): Role[] Join(Role.role_pk = role_user.role_id AND role_user.user_id = User.user_field1)

Role
    role_pk: increments PrimaryKey
    name: string
    users(): User[]
```

# Many to many (with intermediate model)

```
AssignedRole
    role_id: unsignedInteger
    user_id: unsignedInteger
    expires: integer

User
    roles(): Role[] Join(Role.id = AssignedRole.role_id AND AssignedRole.user_id = User.id)

Role
    users(): User[] 
```

# Many to many (pivot name, pivot timestamps)

```
User
    podcasts(): Podcast[] As("subscription"), PivotWithTimestamps

Podcast
    users()
```

Now you can do `$user->podcasts[0]->subscription->created_at`.

# Mirror tables

```
User2 mirror(User)
```

Now `User2` will be exactly like `User`
